# Banking
GUI using VS, C# and the EDP model

Scenario 
A bank has been developing a simple login system allowing their customer to log into the system and check their current balance. 
This system however is outdated and does not provide much response to the user’s current errors or invalid entries.
A project has been commissioned to further this application to better inform the user.

A)	Design a piece of software using event driven programming solution that identifies the components, data/file structures, 
makes effective use of the Integrated Development Environment and incorporates onscreen help for users (e.g. Error messages, end user guidance). 
Your design should offer the bank an improved login experience for the user. The design components should include at least five of the following
(but is not limited to only five):

•	Public
•	Private
•	Protected
•	Text boxes
•	Combo boxes
•	List boxes 
•	Check boxes
•	Radio buttons	•	Listeners
•	Exceptions
•	Projects
•	Classes
•	Variables
•	Strings
•	Arrays
•	Images

B)	Implement your design using Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment with C#. Your program should include on-screen help for users, 
including ToolTips and error messages where appropriate.  Include error handling for any database/ file errors.
